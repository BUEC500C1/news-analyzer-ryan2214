We are investigating \nthe integration of these devices with arrays of metallic or dielectric nanoparticles (metasurfaces), \ndesigned so that only light incident along a prescribed set of directions can be detected.  The \nresulting angle-sensitive photodetectors may enable the development of cameras with \nunprecedented size miniaturization, record large fields of view, and capable of performing basic \nimage-processing functionalities (e.g., for contrast enhancement and edge detection) directly in the \noptical domain.  The project will involve full-wave electromagnetic simulations based on \ncommercially available software to design the required nanoparticle arrays. \n \nProf. Dal Negro \n \n1. \"Physics-driven machine learning for magneto-electric metamaterials design\" \nBackground: CE, EE \nExpected period: 1 year total with possible extension \nCandidates must send me a CV \n \n2. \"Intensity-based inverse scattering and lensless imaging with learning methods\" \nBackground: CE, EE \nExpected period: 1 year total with possible extension \nCandidates must send me a CV \n3. \"Engineering multifunctional diffractive optics in the quantum regime\" \nBackground: EE \nExpected period: 1 year total with possible extension \nCandidates must send me a CV \n4. \"Wave localization in number-theoretic landscapes\" \nBackground: EE, but also Math and Physics \nExpected period: 1 year total with possible extension \nCandidates must send me a CV \n5. \"Lattice-based cryptography on optical quasicrystals\" \nBackground: EE, but also Math and Physics \n \n \n \n \nExpected period: 1 year total with possible extension \nCandidates must send me a CV \n \nProf. Lei Tian \n1.
